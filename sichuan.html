              <strong class="strong">Sichuan</strong> is an inland proince in Southwestern China, with a population of more than 80 million people. Its central part is within a huge basin surrounded by high mountains, resulting in a warm damp climate. The wet weather encouraged people to develope spicy dishes, which are believed to keep moisture from body.

                <h2>Sichuan Hotpot</h2>
                <p>
                    Hotpot serves as one of symbols for Sichuan province.
                    Similar to fondueï¼Œit cooks continuously added raw ingredients in simmering flavored broth.
                    As you can see in the picture, hotpot with pepper is hot both in temperature and flavor.

              <h2>Mapo Tofu</h2>
                <p>
                    Mapo means a pock-marked grandma in Chinese, and by word of mouth, this cuisine was created by her.
                    Combined with chili broad bean paste from Sichuan's Pixian county, 
                    the tofu owns a complex flavor, which is numbing, spicy hot, physically hot, fresh, tender, aromatic and flaky.

            <div class="slice text"><h2>Sliced Beef and Ox Tongue in Chilli Sauce</h2>
              <p>
                  This cuisine has a scaring Chinese name "husband and wife lung pieces".
                  That was a joke played by michievous children on sliced beef made by a married couple.
                  Its taste is again spicy and mouth-numbing, which is perfect to serve as an appetizer.
